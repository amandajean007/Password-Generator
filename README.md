# Password-Generator

## Description
You choose length, characters, and symbols and it generates a password which you can copy to the clipboard.
The motivation behind this project was to find a way to easily make up strong passwords to fit the password requirements of any site.
I learned how to connect the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS pages. I learned how to make functions that include variables and how to use an addEventListener for user interaction with the site.

## Installation
Put https://amandajean007.github.io/Password-Generator/ into your browser on any computer or smart device to run the website.

## Usage
Input the parameters of your password then click "Generate Password." Copy it to your clipboard for easy reference.
